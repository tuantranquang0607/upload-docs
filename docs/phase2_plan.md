# Next Phase Development Plan

This document outlines the remaining steps to deliver the full document processing application. The goal is a containerized stack that allows users to upload documents via a React UI, extracts text using Apache Tika, stores data in PostgreSQL and runs tests via GitHub Actions.

## Overview of Current State

- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript service capable of accepting uploads and forwarding them to Apache Tika. The code persists documents and extracted text to PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend**: React application generated with Create React App. Currently minimal with no upload form.
- **Docker Compose**: Defines services for backend, frontend, Postgres and Tika. Backend container already has a Dockerfile. Frontend container image is not defined yet.
- **Testing**: No automated tests or CI configured.

## Objectives for Phase 2

1. **Frontend Upload UI**
   - Add a simple form allowing users to select a file and POST it to `/api/upload`.
   - Show upload progress and display the extracted text once processing completes.
   - Handle errors such as invalid file types or server failures.

2. **Backend Enhancements**
   - Replace plain `console.log` statements with a structured logging library (e.g. `winston`).
   - Add validation around uploads (limit file size, enforce required field `document`).
   - Provide an endpoint for listing all uploaded documents and their status.

3. **Docker and Kubernetes**
   - Create a `frontend/Dockerfile` and update `docker-compose.yml` to build and run the React application in a container.
   - Prepare Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, Ingress) for backend and frontend for future deployment.

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Use **Jest** for unit tests in the backend (DB functions, route handlers) and integration tests against a running test database.
   - Use **Playwright** for end‑to‑end tests covering the upload flow in the UI.
   - Configure `package.json` scripts in both projects to run these tests.
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow to install dependencies, run lint, and execute Jest and Playwright suites on every pull request.

5. **Documentation**
   - Expand the root `README.md` with setup instructions, environment variables and local development workflow.
   - Document how to run the stack via Docker Compose and where to access each service.
   - Provide a short guide on deploying to Kubernetes using the manifests from step 3.

## Recommended File Layout

```
/docs                Project documentation
/frontend            React application
/backend             Express API
/k8s                 Kubernetes manifests
```

## Milestones

1. ~~Build the upload form in the React app and verify manual file uploads work against the running backend.~~ ✅
2. ~~Introduce structured logging and an additional API endpoint for listing documents.~~ ✅
3. ~~Containerize the frontend and confirm the Docker Compose stack works end‑to‑end.~~ ✅
4. ~~Add automated Jest and Playwright tests. Verify GitHub Actions runs them on push.~~ ✅
5. ~~Create Kubernetes manifests and document deployment steps.~~ ✅

Completion of these tasks will deliver a functional, testable, containerized application ready for enterprise deployment.
